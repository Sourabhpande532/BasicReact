 👩‍💻♦️What is "react"? Do you know "react" is a library or framework  🤔??
 =>Library, Major defference between two of them is that,it takes minimum efforts.so when I say something as a library framework it simply means full fladges framework when we build our apps/web it needs a lot of things it needs routing, you'll need different routes where you can go different pages migrating through over that and there are lot more component inside your app react come as a small "library".

 -By the term Library it mean what's ? 
  -some who already write some code for us that's exactly it is->see 👇 
  -ref: - 🖇️https://unpkg.com/react@18.2.0/umd/react.development.js

  @🫣sideInfo:> who give the superpowers to "window" object while in terminal 
  @🫣obivious:> Js engine so, similarly where we'll get superpowers of react?
  @🫣obivious:> in react library, so with you can do stuff:-> go in terminal & write it down individully React,ReactDom just like window object it does give the same scenarios

  😍😎🥰Best thing about react is that it does not enforce you to do anything it can use any library & it is build by open sourch powered by open source so to get all this functinality we need something know as 😱"BUNDLERS"-⤵️
  --Categories into three parts 3;
    #vite
    #parcel 
    #webpack
    it give lot more superpowers to us.
    in this we'r go with parcel 
-❕Defference=> most BUNDLERS Do almost same Job.



  👩‍💻🤔♦️ What is CDN(Content Delivery Network)?
   =>  :-> it is a faster way to fetching that code.  

🎈@Followup@🎈...................

👩‍💻🤔♦️ have you see images corousers,so what it is? is it libraray or framework🤔??
 =>it's Javascript Library Major defference between two of them is that,it takes minimum efforts to just put into our code
 it just take minimum efforts for a library to just put it inside our code.

🤼Tool Using 🤼
   - Google Chrome
   - Vs Code 
 
♦️🛕H.W read about "Emmet"👀
-🎗️Emmet is a toolkit for web developers that can significantly improve your HTML and CSS workflows.
-🎗️It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time.
-🎗️Also relying on Emmet's "auto completion" means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust and valid files


👩‍💻♦️ As we saw react it is a Javascript libraray when we say it is a library it mean any other Library & you can inject this react into you'r code as many as times or bare minimum things. 
👩‍💻♦️ React it is a global object/element/variable you can use anywhere.

👩‍💻🤔♦️ how does browser get to know about this document.createElement("h1") what is "document" in this case?
         => it's obivious it comes from browser Api's browser know what is document. browser has a js engine it is knows basically what is happning inside you'r browser & browser know about 
         window.document; <= who gave us this functinality, it's obivious 'Js-engin'
👩‍💻🤔♦️what is createElement >
->it's an API's          

♦️🛕H.W read about "react cdn"👀

ref: - 🖇️ https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html 
go and inject it into 📂index.html 


♦️🛕H.W read about "What is crossorigin"👀
Ref:-> https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html
-🎗️If you serve React from a CDN, we recommend to keep the crossorigin attribute set:
""<script crossorigin src="..."></script>""
-🎗️We also recommend to verify that the CDN you are using sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * HTTP header:
-🎗️This enables a better error handling experience in React 16 and later

 -🎗️Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain
 @what is CORS??
 -🎗️Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

👩‍💻🤔♦️ what is shortest program of javascript ??
     =>The shortest JS program is"empty file". Because even then, JS engine does a lot of things. As always, even in this case, it creates the GEC(general education curriculam) which has memory space and the execution context. JS engine creates something known as 'window'

    🎈or in react what is shortest program?
     =>just inject the code & add somm !"CDN" link into it. to ensure that just go in browser terminl and write  
     -"React" -> enter"
     -"ReactDom" -> enter"
     -"React.createElement" -> enter"

👩‍💻🤔♦️ why there is two script line uses react in CDN ??
      => it just not limited for browser it's limited for mobile,tab,3d react also might be aware or not do you know react Native.

      ---------------------
     🙋[@identyfire🤖[1st]
👩‍💻🤔♦️ How to create <h1>Hellow,react</h1> and show to home page in react??
       react gives us this api's which is know as react.createElement it expect three arguments here. 
      1st - tags, 2nd - object, 3rd - content(inside h1)
      task is inject it into "<div class="root"/>" need to tell the react root element there is the place where we need to inject code so react gives you a api know as ReactDom.    
      
👩‍💻🤔♦️ what is ReactDom??
       -  it is responsible for all DOM operations/manipulation.
       -🎗️first link in a CDN which is "react" is a core library of react & 
       -🎗️2nd one which is ReactDom that it is a library it gives you access to document object model(DOM) let's suppose i want write code which goes into browser so it happend one base on "ReactDom"
       -🎗️let's suppose I've root & want to run react code inside root & want to modify this so how do i tell react this where we need to inject our code this is place where want to run my react code so react gives a API that's hwo react-dom

      -🎗️Dom mean web version of react we've injected web version of react.
       because I'm going to modify my dom reading something form Dom that's is 2nd picture came into play "ReactDom" how do we modify in the wake "crateRoot"(this tell the react what is going to inject that it mean tell "root")
       -🎗️ReactDom.createRoot -> react needs to where you want to inject code.

👩‍💻🤔♦️ What is React element at the end of the day & when you do react.render() what it will happend?

       it's an "object", & ans => render will modify you'r dom      
      -----------------------
      🙋[@identyfire🤖[2nd]
      what if, if you console.log(heading) what it will prient it?
        => react element is nothing but an objects isn't it amazing at the end of the day it feels like it's not jsx, this is a plane JS object of type h1.

 👩‍💻🤔♦️ Now how does react stored this h1 element ??
        =>if you explore this link 
        🖇️https://unpkg.com/react@18.2.0/umd/react.development.js so inside link code is taking code as an argument ("h1",{},"Hello,This is Bahadur")<-- this one & making an object out of it.

 👩‍💻🤔♦️ At the end of the day if anybuddy's ask you what is react element?? and what is react ??.
       =>it's obivious it's an "objects" {}

 👩‍💻🤔♦️ what if || or what'll happened root.render(heading) when you passing a react Element inside the root? 
       => so when you pass this inside render methods so basically this render methods      
        takes in an reactElement & modifies our dom go and check on web page do inspect and check in Element section.
        now,we got the h1 over there how does the h1 came in? that react-dom library that render funntion put this up it is as simple as that 

👩‍💻🤔♦️ what is best thing ABOUT react ?
      => it's an API and fact: in react we called "tags" as element(e.g "h1","spam"...).        
        
👩‍💻🤔♦️  Can i do innerHTML on this ??
     => yes, man obivious

👩‍💻!🤔♦️ Can we've multiple roots 🤔🤨 ??
     => No,beacause it's SPA all code you've to inject at one place which is know as root.geneally you'll see only one root No matter how big it is it persists with one root and one render methods.  

👩‍💻!🤔♦️ what if between header and footer two of therm is root just above?
      => let me tell you why it is a library when you build a whole website using html,css,and js it gets huge let's take a look above e.g still react work inside this between two of them what is root, root is the place where react run.
      that is beauty of react where we can do more stuff you can add react you'r existing project also. just we need to change id it as simple as that. but we don't have to do this stuff for the sake of good practice it's for knowledge.

       😈@conslusion@
       -we got access something know as "React"(it's kind of global variable) + 
       -now it has something know as createElement + responsible for h1 tag +
       -endly we realize react it's but an "object" +
       -now we've ReactDom + responsible for all Dom operations 
       -so why do we need createRoot - react needs to know where you want to inject

      ----------------------
      🙋[@identyfire🤖[3rd]]  why there is empty "object" {}

       👩‍💻!🤔♦️ why there is empty "object" {} in line no. 29 arround between?
          @FOLLOUP=> react expect 3thing -Tags, attributes, children
         🖇️https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement 
             Go and explore this link
          - const element = createElement(type, props, ...children)
          - so this object {} is an used let's suppose there is an <h1 id= "title">Hellow World"<h1>
    👩‍💻!🤔♦️ So how do we do that in react this exact stuff ??
          => So this is place where we can inject our code so this "object"{} is responsible for this so this "objects" gives a this parameters id="title"; so, whatever i'm passed it over there {....here...} goes into my h1 tag like this see above e.g. so all this tag attributes comes from this object 
          🧐@Doubt:=> don't believe go and inspect and see into Element section!

  @😍interviewPerspective😍@
  imp❕👩‍💻!🤔♦️ what if, whenever we pass root.render(heading), inside the reader function this get's injected inside the root which is in public/index.html let's suppose there is lot more stuff inside over there three h1 tag with same id what it'll happend. but i'm in react just render my heading what will happend? will they be replace or will come belew this?

  => but let me tell my friend this is interesting stuff that react will overwrite everything just refresh the page it'll not even a render single line of code. whatever you passed it in react there it just overwrite it only display whatever you pass in root.render(..) beasue we told the ReactDom so that's how it happend. sometimes you'r root is not configured properly?
  =Go => inspect; 
  @conclusion@ so instead of rendering over ther just give a message "Not render" react won't be able to show anything.

👩‍💻!🤔♦️ while refresing why loads "not render name" for some sec?? because it loads the document from initial leval so it takes time to react go and inspect go in Network tab - check All -and disable cache it should be "on"

🙄😏H.w async vs defer attributes in Javascript?
=> 
-))-async and deffer are boolean attributes that are along use with that script tag to loop the external script efficiently into our webpage.

-))-If you're working with JavaScript, it's important to understand the difference between async and defer attributes. Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, without blocking other elements on the page. Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading.
-))- when you load the webpage two major things that happning in your browser one is html parsing 2nd one is loading up the scripts.

So, loading of the script containt two parts one is fetcing the script from network & 2nd One is Atually executing the script line by line. they will check the both scenarios so how they behave with this three things async | defer | normal script tags

let's understand in three ways 
➡️HTMl parsing script => <script/>  => so in the normal scenarios.
Browser is parsing the HTML line by line  ---> suddenly encounters script tags over that points & html parsing it puase till the fetcing Data from network -->
@Conclude => Duaration in time Atually Js blocking the stuff between's it's not good things. 
@🤔SideNote: Async Does not give you guarenty the order of execution of script but ❕🫣deffer does always preff deffer.
when to use asyn suppose you have to load some external script let's take a e.g of google anylytics script which are point modular that are independent are normal code so that time it make sence to use this one O.W not.
➡️HTMl parsing script with Async attributes=>
 so Html parsing is goes on + in paraller fetch the script from network & as soon as the script are fetch & avalable in the browser then script are executed only then html parsing is continue. in this period of time html parsing is block.
➡️HTMl parsing script with deffer attributes=>
 Once the html parsing is complete then it will load the script that's it's only executed till the HTML parsing until or unless completed o.w not Html parsing is continuosly goes on & script are fetch in parallel 
@🤔SideNote:Mostly use deffer attributes because it maintains the order of script execution of script

👩‍💻🤔♦️ what if if am creating complex div h1 str & how do i create this dose one in React 👇??
    <div id = "container">
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h1>Heading 2</h1>
    <h1>Heading 3</h1>
    </div> 
    Go => 📂App.js 

👩‍💻🤔♦️ Do you know what is Data Structure use for stroing memory storage??
   => that is "callstack" callstack is defferent that memory heap So, what happend is go ahead and stored it in memory while creafting some code like variable & function.

👩‍💻🤔♦️ Do you know what is function expression ??
   =>  yes, when we call annanomous function and stored it specifically into some variable is know as function expression.
   e.g const x function (){console.log("This is Annnoumous function");}
   So, when i say it's an expression what do i mean so 
   -expression is something that evaluate something e.g 34,45,console.log(x)
   -expression is something which something execute.


--------===---------

@identyfire[🙊(explaination about react and props)] 👇

☝️Now, As the 3rd element something which put inside a div what we've to put inside one heading1 & heading2 into it. so in react we pass in as a array when we've to pass multiple child/childrean then we pass something like this we can pass as many children as we want here.

🤔🙄can we pass anyname inside object or just put id,className attributes?Will this work?
yes, it is work(Go and inspect) & given the fact you can put anything inside over there.& it just not a attributes react gives fancy name know as "Props".
props -> it is just like property & just like an attributes where you can inject anything.

@See what is react in detail at top of docs.

🤔🙄what is caching? & do we need chching?
-Yes,Caching is a mechanism to improve the performance of any type of application. Technically, caching is the process of storing and accessing data from a cache. But wait, what is a cache? A cache is a software or hardware component aimed at storing data so that future requests for the same data can be served faster.
-In computing, a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data


🤔🙄In,react when we have to pass multiple thing in div element need to pass "childrean" inside array it's mandatory overthere e.g [head1,head2]" heading1 "& "heading2" stored in const & crate element just belew one =>h1,h2 forms & put it into divContainer. 
@🔺CODE: e.g const heading = React.createElement("div",{},[heading1,heading2]
heading1 & heading2 it's nothing but an reactElement and reactElement it's object. 

🤔🙄 WHY JSX in react ??(@QuestionBaseOn_🔝↖️)
-🎗️Let's supppose yo'v to create big html file So do you think is it complicated ?? or easy🧐?? it's obivious "complicated" let's suppose you've to build whole website so it it possible or complicate stuff like that react came with building React.createElement(...) 👈but "this was not" not user friendly. 
-🎗️so,this complicated stuff or to get rid of this complication & one more due to not user friendly stuff JSX came into picture.
-🎗️because react came in with the idea of html inside JavaScript css into javascript so don't have go in you'r HTML doc that's why.

So, let's move to proacticle one.

🤔🙄 what is defference between react.producttion.js and react.development.js in CDN link ? what does that? go and react cdn website.
-This are the minified files which contain similar question & there is no major difference.
react.production: it's much more optimize way for product use. 

🤔🙄 what is functinality of root.render?
it just modifies our DOM this is the way.
