/**
 @PROCESS-> ----Of Making App start from now Onwords----

in this one we'r using parsel,
So what is parsel🤔??

it is something know as "Package" By the term Package it's mean what ? it is kind of a modeule or a package of Javascript files some peace of code. for that we need to use @package manager.
-npm(Officially Npm Does not stand for "Node package manager" but it is basically doing the same thing)

🤔 Do you know what BUNDLERS React use in general originally which create-react-app?
-> They use "webpack" Most React apps will have their files “bundled” using tools like Webpack, Rollup or Browserify and !Babel it's an compiler(Babel enables React developers to use the latest JavaScript syntax in their components. Babel transpiles modern JavaScript for use in React)

-@working
 on create-react-app
 -@TERMINAL_process
 -npm init + enter

 👋🤔So what does that mean when you've package-manager? what is package.json? what is Npm🤔? & 🤔why npm?
 -😶‍🌫️it's an amazing npm configuration which npm needs. 
 -😶‍🌫️coming to "npm"->it is use to manage our packages
 -😶‍🌫️coming to "why npm"-> -⤵️

 a)-becz our entire application base on packages so we need package in order to run. 
 b)-it does not run on just react-only it has lot of superpowers which we need & those superpowers comes from defferent packages which packages are present by using npm. it is like maven for "UI" 
 c)-in addition to our react app cannot be build by just injecting into our web it has packages which provide more powers via npm.
 @🫣CONCLUSION -> react it's powered by lot of thing,packages let just say we need to minify up,BUNDLES things up, remove console log let's suppose optimize our apps so for that we need lot more "helper packages" & those helpers packages comes inside "npm".
